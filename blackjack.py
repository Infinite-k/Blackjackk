At the beginning of each round, both players are dealt two cards where the dealers(computers) first card is revealed only and both your cards are displayed.

You are given a chance to draw more cards. The players can either â€˜hit(draw more cards)â€™ or â€˜stand(skip the turn)â€™. If the player calls out â€˜yâ€™, they are given an extra card. They can then call out â€˜nâ€™ if they do not wish to draw any more cards. The player can â€˜HITâ€™ as many times as they wish, but have to aim not to â€˜bustâ€™ (exceed a total of 21).

If the player busts, they immediately lose the game.

After you have played and either y or n, the dealer takes their turn. They can, again, either â€˜HITâ€™ or â€˜STANDâ€™. If the dealerâ€™s hand exceeds 21, you win immediately.

If the dealer reaches a valid hand, the cards are totalled and each playerâ€™s hand is compared to the dealerâ€™s. If the player scored higher than the dealer, they win. If the player ties with the dealer, the game draws. Otherwise, the player loses.

A perfect hand combines an ace with a 10, Jack, Queen or King and is known as a â€˜Blackjackâ€™ which is euqual to 21.
