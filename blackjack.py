At the beginning of each round, both players are dealt two cards where the dealers(computers) first card is revealed only and both your cards are displayed.

You are given a chance to draw more cards. The players can either ‘hit(draw more cards)’ or ‘stand(skip the turn)’. If the player calls out ‘y’, they are given an extra card. They can then call out ‘n’ if they do not wish to draw any more cards. The player can ‘HIT’ as many times as they wish, but have to aim not to ‘bust’ (exceed a total of 21).

If the player busts, they immediately lose the game.

After you have played and either y or n, the dealer takes their turn. They can, again, either ‘HIT’ or ‘STAND’. If the dealer’s hand exceeds 21, you win immediately.

If the dealer reaches a valid hand, the cards are totalled and each player’s hand is compared to the dealer’s. If the player scored higher than the dealer, they win. If the player ties with the dealer, the game draws. Otherwise, the player loses.

A perfect hand combines an ace with a 10, Jack, Queen or King and is known as a ‘Blackjack’ which is euqual to 21.
